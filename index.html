        <p>
          Training a new model on a large dataset is an increasingly difficult
          task in machine learning due to the growing size of datasets from
          enhanced collection methods. Dataset distillation, a technique that
          addresses this issue by producing a smaller representative dataset,
          can address this issue by providing <b>distilled</b> datasets that
          contain most information from the original datasets. Past works have
          proposed <i>model centric</i> approaches, specifically considering
          neural networks trained on image datasets as target models. However,
          the nature of tabular datasets compared to that of image datasets add
          new challenges to exsisting image distillation methods. Tabular
          datasets contain samples in a single dimension, unlike the two (or
          three) dimensional pixel grids found in image datasets. In addition,
          tree-based models such as XGBoost often outperform neural
          network-based models, which can be challenging for previous NN-based
          distillation methods from image datasets. Thus, we seek to identify
          whether image-based data distillation methods can be directly applied
          to tabular datasets, and whether there exists other methods that
          outperform previous methods, examining various methods from a
          <i>model agnostic</i> point of view.
